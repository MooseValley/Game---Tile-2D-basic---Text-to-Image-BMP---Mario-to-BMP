# Game - Tile, 2D, basic - Text to Image (BMP) - Mario to BMP

I watched the movie "GamePlay - The Video Game Revolution" back on 2-Feb-2015 and it reminded me how simple the Mario character game sprite is - just 16x16 pixels.  See screen shots from the movie included in the above repo.

And I thought I'd mess around and reconstruct the Mario sprite from a simple text map, just for fun.

So here's my code ... just in case anyone else finds it useful.
